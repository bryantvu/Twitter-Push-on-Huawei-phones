### Frequency

In regards to push notification frequency, the majority of apps only send immediate push notifications for urgent items such as Direct Messages and Emergency Alerts. Otherwise the majority of notifications are grouped togther and sent as a bulk notification.

### Huawei Phones

Twitter uses Firebase Cloud Messaging to send push notifications which does not work on HMS phones. The only solution to this issue is for Twitter and other apps that use Firebase Cloud Messaging to integrate HMS Push Kit for push support on Huawei devices.
