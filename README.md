## Twitter Push Notifications

### Content Types

Below are the different content types that Twitter users will receive via push notification. Based on these options, it is unlikely that Twitter will notify the user if a new version exists.

### Frequency

In regards to push notification frequency, the majority of apps only send immediate push notifications for urgent items such as Direct Messages and Emergency Alerts. Otherwise the majority of notifications are grouped togther and sent as a bulk notification.

### Huawei Phones

Twitter uses Firebase Cloud Messaging to send push notifications which does not work on HMS phones. The only solution to this issue is for Twitter and other apps that use Firebase Cloud Messaging to integrate HMS Push Kit for push support on Huawei devices.
